# Title of the project : STUDENT ATTENDANCE MANAGEMENT

# Abstract :

#### Attendance management is important to every single organization; it can decide whether or not an organization such as educational institutions, public or private sectors will be successful in the future. Organizations will have to keep a track of people within the organization such as employees and students to maximize their performance. Managing student attendance during lecture periods has become a difficult challenge. The ability to compute the attendance percentage becomes a major task as manual computation produces errors, and wastes a lot of time. For the stated reason, an efficient Web-based application for attendance management system is designed to track student's activity in the class. This application takes attendance electronically and the records of the attendance are storing in a database.
